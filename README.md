# IoT-Enabled Patient Vital Signs Monitoring with Emergency Alerts

## Project Overview

This system continuously monitors critical patient health parameters including:

* Heart Rate & SpO2 (using **MAX30102**)
* Body Temperature (using **MLX90614** contactless sensor)
* Fall/Movement Detection (using **MPU6050** accelerometer/gyroscope)

All readings are processed by the **Silicon Labs BRD2605A Rev A02** microcontroller board. Data can be transmitted wirelessly via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a smartphone or monitoring dashboard. Emergency alerts are triggered automatically if abnormal health conditions are detected.

## Pin Connections

### MAX30102 (I2C)

* SDA → MCU SDA
* SCL → MCU SCL
* VIN → 3.3V
* GND → GND

### MLX90614 (I2C)

* SDA → MCU SDA
* SCL → MCU SCL
* VCC → 3.3V
* GND → GND

### MPU6050 (I2C)

## Working Principle

1. Sensors continuously collect patient health parameters.
2. Microcontroller reads sensor data via I2C protocol.
3. Data is processed & evaluated for safety thresholds.
4. BLE transmits data to mobile dashboard.
5. If dangerous conditions are detected → alert is triggered.
